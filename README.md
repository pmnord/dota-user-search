# Dota2 Player Stats Lookup

Live Demo: https://pmnord.github.io/dota-player-lookup/

**Limited to 6 searches per minute. Each search makes 10 calls to the API and the API is limited to 60/minute.**

## Todos
=======
### Todos

1. Display match dates more neatly
1. Style the app (look for a banner image)

### Notes

This project has definitely showed me the limitations of working with a small number of API calls - I would like to add further search refinement but it would require many more calls to the API
- Such as showing the user a person's percentile compared to the average hero performance - which would recall a separate API call for each hero to get their average hero performance
